# Project-Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a project with the Odin website for me to work on the skills I have learned with Java Script.
It's a Rock, Paper, Scissors game that for now will only work in the console.log, but should let the user play rock, paper, scissors with the computer.
It uses a function to play rock, paper, scissors; and then loops that function five times.
