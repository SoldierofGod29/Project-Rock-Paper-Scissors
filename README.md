# Project-Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a project with the Odin website for me to work on the skills I have learned with Java Script.
It's a Rock, Paper, Scissors game that use to only work in the console.log, but now let's the player select their choice of rock, paper, or scissors using a
button. It then plays a round of rock, paper, scissors with the computer and displays the winner of the round. 
After five rounds played it declares a winner of the match.
